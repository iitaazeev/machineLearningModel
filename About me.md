# machineLearningModel
The first Machine learning model i made for my individual engineering project for university

**disclaimer*** A lot of this code came from SentDex, a great youtuber who got me interesting in machine learning.

Hi,
My name is jordan i study computer and network tech,
I work as an IT support analyst.
At the start of uni i was forced to do java as that was part of the curriculum (i absolutely hated it),
but we got to choose our own language for this project. 

I chose to do a deep learning model (without the appropriate knowledge of python),
It is a very basic model. the model is pretty shit*** im certain that was due to my dataset though.

The report is included if you would like to read it, which i submitted with my code.

The one big issue is that i wanted to have it in real-time through my webcam. I think i could have achieved this by defining a function 
in my 'testing the model.py' which, using CV2 took a picture through the webcam, then names the image (incremental) automatically, so i wouldnt have to stop the program,
then load in another image.file.name

any feedback on this would be great!
